What’s been missing is the patient’s perspective. This small study asked patients in an inpatient psychiatric setting to provide feedback on 3 different vignettes meant to introduce the REACH VET program (VA’s predictive analytics for suicide program).

At 6 months, only differences in depression remained. Several protective factors improved (timeframe not indicated; cohesion, morale, bonds to classmates, perception that classmate support healthy behaviors). Others did not change significantly (coping attitudes, loneliness, emotional dysregulation). The 1-month reduction in suicidal ideation and depression in the Wingman-Connect recipients was mediated by a latent factor capturing degree of cohesion/health within each class. Honestly, just nice to see a controlled study on this topic and in a military population! Not sure about feasibility of the program for longer durations (or whether it could be embedded within units as part of ongoing training) or for implementation by military personnel -Trainees in classrooms provide a stable platform in which to implement this. Wonder whether and how this model could apply to other units, where there’s considerable turnover. 13.8 October 2020 Cox CR, Moscardini EH, Cohen AS, et al.

They didn’t observe this and add to a growing literature that this is not observed. They did include non-linear terms and found those were associated with ideation longitudinally. Given the complexity of suicide and the fact that thus far linear predictors aren’t predicting a whole lot (adding to prediction or understanding of suicide risk), the non-linear piece was nice to see.

Although unlikely to influence our public health work, it’s an interesting area and one to be aware of. From the conclusion: “A biological approach offers biomarkers to guide a personalized medical approach to prevention of suicide, a way to track fluctuating risk, and a way to track treatment effects. Such biomarkers assume greater importance if they can detect risk when very suicidal patients choose to withhold information of a plan and intent to suicide in order to avoid being thwarted.” Rizk MM, Galfalvy H, Miller JM, et al.

When Soldiers were referred to BH by others (sig other, friend, peer), their suicidal ideation scores were lower than when they were command-referred. There are many ways to interpret this finding (e.g., family members have more interaction/know Soldiers and can intervene earlier, leaders use more overt criteria indicative of more severe symptoms). Those who self-referred had SI scores right in the middle of others and command-referred. It would be very interesting to replicate this with a larger sample. I believe the required data are ones we have in-house or can get access to. 13.9 September 2020 Bryan CJ, Bryan AO, Anestis MD.
