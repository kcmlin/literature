    - **COMMENT**: Review of interventions for preventing PTSD. The authors note there's not much out there on this topic and that more is needed. The most promising data are for intervening with trauma-focused CBT among those diagnosed with acute stress. Important implications not only for deployment-related experiences but also ACEs and military sexual assault.

    - **COMMENT**: A bit outside of what we do but wanted to share. From the abstract, "Black and Brown people make up more than half of those incarcerated in the United States (despite comprising just 32% of the total population). In the absence of an intersectional, antiracist, structurally informed approach, any attempt by the mental health care system to stem the overrepresentation of people with serious mental illness in the criminal legal system will fail. This article provides an overview of the current mental health care systemâ€™s shortcomings in serving this population. It proposes concrete steps to address these shortcomings, with a special focus on race and social determinants of health."

From the paper, "our research shows that the dominant narrative about drivers of health and health equity is powerful and resistant to change: Most Americans believe that health is predominantly influenced by individual behaviors and access to health care, as opposed to structural and social factors, and health equity is not a widespread priority... Americans surveyed in 2018 still lack knowledge about the social determinants of health or the role of community on health outcomes"

About 1 in 5 had experienced discrimination in healthcare settings, most experiencing it repeatedly. The most common forms (in decreasing order) were: race/ethnic, education/income, weight, sex, and age. Females, younger, poorer, and less healthy patients were more likely to experience discrimination in healthcare settings. Would be curious (as with all of this discrimination work) to see how this plays out in the Army.
